# clockbørt

an analog clocking tool based on the teensy micro controller.

i wrote clockbørt in order to sync my modular, my mfb urzwerg pro sequencer (which has some wonky analog clock requirements), teenage engineering POs, and one or more gameboys running LSDJ.

it's far from finished, but in its current state it's useful to me. expansion and changes will happen.
